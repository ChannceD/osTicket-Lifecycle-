# 🎫 Ticket Lifecycle in osTicket

This project demonstrates my understanding of the complete lifecycle of a support ticket using osTicket, from ticket creation to resolution. This workflow mirrors real-world help desk scenarios, and showcases how issues are tracked, updated, escalated, and resolved efficiently using a ticketing system.
